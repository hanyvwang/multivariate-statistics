# Multivariate Statistics

This repository contains my assignment code for **S&DS 5630: Multivariate Statistics**, a graduate-level course focused on the theory and application of multivariate statistical methods.

The code includes implementations of core techniques used in multivariate data analysis, with an emphasis on dimension reduction, classification, hypothesis testing, and latent variable modeling. Methods covered include principal component analysis (PCA), discriminant analysis, multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), cluster analysis (e.g., hierarchical and k-means clustering), ordination methods (e.g., correspondence analysis), factor analysis, structural equation modeling (SEM), and related multivariate statistical techniques.

**Course Instructor**: Jonathan Reuning-Scherer
